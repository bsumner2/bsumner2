- 👋 Hi, I’m @bsumner2
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to develop entertainment- (and business-) oriented user applications for fun and possibly for a career further down the road. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# for use in .NET core console applications, WPF applications, as well as for games made with Unity. I want to learn c++ further down the road as well.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, as I want to get a solid foundation before I feel comfortable making the commitment to collaborate, as I would feel bad if I didnt pull my weight.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can contact me through my email. burton.sumner2@gmail.com
