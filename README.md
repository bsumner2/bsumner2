- Greetings, my name is Burton O Sumner
- I’m interested in learning how to develop, both entertainment- , and business-oriented user applications for fun and possibly for a career further down the road. 
- I’m currently studying Computer Science at the University of South Carolina. This semester I am focused on learning the fundamentals of algorithmic design with Java,
  as well as the fundamentals of digital logic design, i.e. working with the hardware end - like with Arduino kits, using binary arithmetic and switching algebra.
- How to reach me: you can contact me through my email. burton.sumner2@gmail.com
